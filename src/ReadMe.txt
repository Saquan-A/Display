Honestly i think I deserve level 6 if not higher.

Okay so basically i did a lot of stuff differently than his pdf cause i really had no idea how to apporch
this project and it was apperently easier/smoother to do everything on an canvas, also there is no 
toString method because i really didnt know what he wanted those to print out.

Um other little glitches include, repeatdly tapping the start or restart button speeds up the game after it starts over

if the spaceship doesnt destory when you hit it restart the program it fixes that sometimes

aliens give a random set of points of each kill and they can be found on their respective class

Obviously this was done on a Canvas and not a JPanel
